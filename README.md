**Yomi** is not just a downloader; it is a full-stack **Manga Archival Solution**. It is designed to hunt down active mirror sites, bypass "Access Denied" image protections (like Nangca/CDN), and package your manga into professional, metadata-tagged formats ready for media servers like **Kavita**, **Komga**, or **CDisplayEx**.


## ✨ Why Yomi?

### 🌍 1. The Hunter Engine (Auto-Discovery)
Sites like *One Piece* or *Bleach* change domains constantly (w57 -> w58). Yomi's **Hunter Engine** automatically probes potential mirrors, finds the active one, and locks onto the target. You never have to update links manually.

### 🕵️‍♂️ The Sherlock Engine (Deep Scan)
Images hidden behind `403 Forbidden` or deeply nested inside HTML/JavaScript (Nangca CDNs)? **Sherlock** parses the raw HTML, regex-matches the protected assets, and extracts them with surgical precision.

### 📚 The Librarian (Smart Metadata)
Yomi doesn't just give you a file.
* **PDF:** Clean, header-checked documents.
* **CBZ:** Embeds `ComicInfo.xml` automatically. Your reader will know the *Series Name*, *Chapter Number*, and *Title* (e.g., "Chapter 1050: Honor") instantly.

### ⚡ Turbo Mode
Built with a multi-threaded core that acts like a DDoS attack (in a good way). Downloads entire volumes in seconds.
