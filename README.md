**Yomi** is a CLI tool designed for speed and resilience. It uses a **Hybrid Engine** (curl_cffi + requests) to bypass Cloudflare and scraping protections, ensuring you get high-quality images every time.


## ✨ Features

* **🚀 Hybrid Engine:** Smartly switches between `curl_cffi` (to scrape) and `requests` (to download) to defeat "0-byte" ghost files.
* **🧠 Auto-Resume:** Tracks your history in a local SQLite DB. Crashed? Restart and it continues exactly where it left off.
* **📚 Universal Support:** Optimized for Manganato, Manganelo, and 1000+ WordPress-based sites (Asura, Reaper, Flame, W5).
* **📦 Smart Conversion:** Auto-converts chapters to **PDF** or **CBZ** formats.
* **🔍 Built-in Search:** Search for manga directly from your terminal.
* **🎯 Range Selection:** Download specific chapters (e.g., `-r "1-10"`) or fill gaps (`-r "50-60"`).
* **🛡️ Proxy Support:** Built-in tunneling for bypassing region blocks.
